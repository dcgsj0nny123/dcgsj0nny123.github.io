    <td>During this lesson, some strategies I used that were effective were sharing the task so if me or my partner we were struggling then we would ask each other for help as we are both new to python</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Something that prohibited my learning during this lesson was the fact the text size on the computer was extremely high meaning I was not able to see. This meant that I spent the latter part of the lesson attempting to fix this issue. I will work on doing things more sensibly and concentrating harder so this problem won't occur again.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>For next time, I will improve by doing some research and understanding the python programming more so if anything goes wrong, I will know exactly what to do in order to fix it and improve it.</td>
